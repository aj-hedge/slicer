# NOTE TODO: After line-finding (possibly assisted by catalogues produced by other line finders such as SoFiA-2) and saving catalogue,
# also save a template file (if it does not already exist; in input directory) with all the found line UIDs and a space for the user to enter a prior
# redshift for that line (used in later steps)
